# Flaconi Design System - Code of Conduct

1. __Be friendly and patient__.
2. __Be considerate__: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
3. __Be respectful__: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
4. __When we disagree, try to understand why__: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
5. __Remember that we’re different__. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
